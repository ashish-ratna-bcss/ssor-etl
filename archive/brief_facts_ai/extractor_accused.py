=====================================
TASK: ACCUSED ANALYSIS FROM BRIEF FACTS
=====================================

You are given:
1. FIR / Brief Facts text
2. A confirmed list of accused persons linked to this crime.

For EACH person in the accused list, you MUST:
1. Search the ENTIRE text for ALL mentions of their accused_code (A-1, A-2, A1, A2, etc.)
   AND/OR their name.
2. COPY SHARED ACTIONS to EACH individual's role:
   - "A-1 and A-2 purchased..." → assign "Purchased..." to BOTH A-1 AND A-2.
   - "A-1 to A-3 were apprehended..." → assign to A-1, A-2, AND A-3.
   - "Both accused..." / "They..." / "All accused..." → assign to ALL relevant persons.
3. Extract their specific role_in_crime and key_details.
4. For fields annotated [MISSING], extract that field from the text ONLY if present.
5. For accused annotated [ASSIGN_CODE], assign a person code (A1, A2, A3...) based on
   order of first mention in the narrative text.

=====================================
CRITICAL: ROLE EXTRACTION RULES
=====================================
- EVERY accused MUST have role_in_crime describing WHAT THEY DID.
  Examples: "Selling hash oil to customers", "Transporting 120 kg ganja in vehicle",
  "Supplied ganja from Visakhapatnam", "Caught with 378g ganja for personal consumption".
- Key Details: Quantities, drug type, vehicle used, items seized, phone seized.
- Extract strictly from text. Do not guess or fabricate.
- If a person is genuinely not mentioned in text, return role_in_crime: null.

=====================================
STRICT: DO NOT CONFUSE THESE WITH ACCUSED
=====================================
The following persons appear in every FIR but are NOT accused — ignore them completely:
- Police officers of any rank: SI, ASI, SHO, Inspector, PC, HC, HG, WPC, RPC, SIRP,
  IRP, RPF, RHC, IPF, RPS, WRPC, ARPC — these are investigating / arresting officers
- Gazetted Officers (GO) present for search and seizure
- Panchas, mediators, witnesses (often listed as "1) Sri..., 2) Sri..." in text)
- Tahsildar, MRO, Excise Inspector, Prohibition Officer attending scene
- Complainant and their staff / patrol team
